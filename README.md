# Pomodro
Pomodro is a time management app, the idea is to break down work into short intervals, usually 25 minutes, with short breaks in between sessions, usually 5 to 10 minutes. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, Italian word for tomato. The goal is to use each Pomodoro to focus on one specific task, then take a break before starting the next one.
